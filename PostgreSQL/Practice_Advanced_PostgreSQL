/* ___________FUNCTION VOLATILITY_____________
-- three different types:
- volatile (default): can perform any operation, including make changed to database
- stable: cannot update database (i.e. no deleting, inserting, updating). 
  Has better performance when working with large datasets
- immutable: cannot modify database

-- For performance purposes, its good to use the strictest classification possible.
-- Any function with side effects, or which calls a function with side effects, 
must be labled VOLATILE.*/
